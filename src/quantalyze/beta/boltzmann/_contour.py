"""Validate a Fermi-surface contour and prepare it for the conductivity kernels.

`prepare_contour` is the one place the input contract is enforced. It takes
nodes k_n with group velocities v_n = ∇ε/ħ and relaxation times τ_n, and returns
them ordered along the carriers' motion, with the per-segment geometric time
s_n and scattering rate γ_n that the kernels integrate over.

Conventions: SI units, B = +B ẑ, and ħ dk/dt = q v × B, so a carrier moves
along dk ∝ q (v_y, −v_x). Segment n joins node n to node n+1 (indices mod N).

    """Validate a closed Fermi-surface contour and prepare it for the kernels.

    The nodes may be given in either direction and from any starting node. The
    orientation is taken from the velocities, not the input order: the result runs
    along ħ dk/dt = q v × B for B = +B ẑ, and keeps the input's first node first.
    A final node that repeats the first is dropped.

    With drift removal on, the velocity v̄ = Σ ½ s_n (v_n + v_{n+1}) / Σ s_n is
    subtracted from every node. On a closed orbit ∮ v dt = 0 exactly, so v̄ is pure
    discretisation error; removing it with the same trapezoid weights the kernels use
    makes the discrete ∮ v dt vanish, which stops σ_xx from levelling off at high
    field instead of falling as 1/B².

    Args:
        kx: Node wavevectors k_x (m⁻¹), array-like of shape (N,).
        ky: Node wavevectors k_y (m⁻¹), array-like of shape (N,).
        vx: Group velocities v_x = (1/ħ) ∂ε/∂k_x (m/s), shape (N,). Not unit vectors.
        vy: Group velocities v_y = (1/ħ) ∂ε/∂k_y (m/s), shape (N,).
        tau: Relaxation times (s), shape (N,) or a single float; finite and positive.
        charge: Carrier charge q (C), ±e. The default −e is for band electrons; a
            hole-like pocket is described by its inward-pointing velocities, not by q.
        remove_drift: Subtract the discretisation drift v̄ from the velocities.
        period: Reciprocal-lattice vector (G_x, G_y) (m⁻¹) joining the last node of an
            open orbit to its first. Open orbits are not supported yet.

    Returns:
        PreparedContour with the ordered nodes, velocities, s_n, γ_n and drift.

    Raises:

            closed; if the nodes are not ordered along the contour; or if |q| ≠ e.
        NotImplementedError: If `period` is given.

    Warns:
